<p>Female Literary Association of Philadelphia</p>
<p>The Female Literary Association of Philadelphia was formed in 1831, consisting of approximately twenty members who believed they “had a duty to develop their God-given intellectual powers” (Lindhorst 263). While the majority of African American literary societies were formed in response to the tyrannical and immoral oppression against black individuals, the Female Literary Association of Philadelphia wanted to promote their moral and intellectual development, specifically the development of these skills in regards to African American women and girls. Led by Sarah Mapps Douglass, a prominent abolitionist and educator in Philadelphia, these twenty women worked to oppose the common limits placed upon African American women, which was participation in public life as well as literary associations.</p>
<p>Marie Lindhorst wrote an article titled “Politics in a Box: Sarah Mapps Douglass and the Female Literary Association, 1831-1833,” in which she writes that the “goal of the Female Literary Association was self-improvement: education to disprove prejudice and to challenge white belief in the intellectual inferiority of African Americans” (269). Here, it is evident and certain that there was immense prejudice and bigotry, especially during a time where slavery was still existent and, even if a slave was “free,” <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> was not put in place yet, which <em>still</em> did not leave African Americans to be “separate but equal.” The FLA of Philadelphia yearned for equality, especially for African American women, and with the help of Sarah Douglass, these women fought to defy hostility brought on by the white race by advocating for their own intellectual development and the development of all African Americans, inspiring many literary societies and organizations to rise up and root for the African American race.</p>
<p>These members met each Tuesday for “recitation and reading” as mentioned in a blog post titled “Female Literary Association.” The post goes on to mention that each meeting began with an address prepared by a member (more often than not it would be Sarah Douglass), followed by “a scripture reading, silent reflection, and prayer.” The services and benefits of this society ranged from potential publication, although most likely the author would be placed under “anonymous” or a pseudonym, most likely “Lady of Color” (Porter 560), to mutual aid, which was one of the sole purposes of these societies. The FLA of Philadelphia also provided a space for growth and study for these women, seeing as they were deemed morally and intellectually inferior by the white majority and society in general.</p>
<p>These women submitted and wrote pieces that were put in a box and later read, which gained the attention of William Lloyd Garrison, creator of <em>The Liberator</em>, who helped publish the works of these women related to current issues such as colonization, slavery, and so much more. Eventually the FLA of Philadelphia went beyond literary practices and became a prominent part of the anti-slavery movement, in which Sarah Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison worked together to publish these women’s stories as opinions and remarks of current political issues, and with the anti-slavery movement heightening and becoming more recognized (only a few decades away from the amendment abolishing slavery), these women developed the Constitution of the Female Literary Society, sent in by Sarah Douglass to Garrison to be published in <em>The Liberator</em>. Garrison responded to Douglass’ inquiry about whether the constitution had been turned down for publication, in which he responds saying “The formation of this Society is a source of unspeakable satisfaction of my mind,” as mentioned in the “Female Literary Association” blog, going on to further say that her organization would inspire many women around the country to form similar literary socieites, also using their work as a counter-argument to the pro-slavery movement.</p>
<p>This society revolved around the political nature surrounding their existence; the denial of their existence, their lack of knowledge often seen as the key to insubordination, as mentioned by Wheeler and Johnson-Houston in “A Brief History of Library Service to African Americans,” and their overall input on anything that they disapprove of or wish to change. The government did not protect African Americans, specifically African American women in regards to this society, so their formation of this society sought to address the government’s lack of recognition to their abilities as scholars, writers, activists, and so much more. They were deemed unequal, and there was no law to protect them from the brutal conditions and bigotry that they endured. With the formation of this society, these women could write their emotions and frustrations with the country’s bigoted and colonizing nature, sharing their experiences and getting feedback and aid for their writing/expressions.</p>
<p>There were undoubtedly no rights by institutional power to allow the FLA of Philadelphia to exist; the society was primarily informal, and like many other African American literary societies and organizations, there was primarily no protection by institutional power to keep this society running. The society existed to serve the free and enslaved, and even though the Gradual Emancipation Act of 1780 in Pennsylvania existed, it did not condemn the slave-owners or advocate for the immediate freeing of slaves—it sought to “gradually” free slaves from owners, over a lengthy period, which undoubtedly did not improve conditions for slaves or “free” slaves over the next coming decades. During the time the FLA of Philadelphia formed, <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> and <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> did not come into place yet, and even <em>if</em> it was readily present during the 1830’s when the FLA of Philadelphia developed, the hostility towards African Americans in general was, and still is, present. As Wheeler and Johnson-Houston say, there is no “separate but equal;” separate is never equal. In addition to the above laws, even <em>Brown v. Louisiana</em>, which decided that facilities must be nondiscriminatory and equally applicable, did not guarantee an accepting nature for black individuals. We see this in the civil rights movement, decades after the abolishment of slavery, where black individuals are still segregated, attacked, belittled, and even killed in America. Even with racial segregation outlawed, the mental segregation often brought on by white individuals leads to these informal socieites being made to conquer the white supremacy it wishes to dismantle.</p>
<p>The only laws that protected these literary societies and granted mutual aid and appreciation during discriminatory and distraught times was immutable laws, as mentioned by Marie Lindhorst. Lindhorst writes, “In these words, there is strength and defiance, and an understanding that their self-development was a part of this claim on divinely-given rights” (269). These immutable laws, formed as the rights of our day-to-day lives, fostered an environment where these African American women dreamed of equality and education for themselves, their children, their partners, and so many more. While their society existed informally with no protection under the law for their society and themselves, they persevered and were granted potential publication, advocacy from people like William Lloyd Garrison, and the defiance to tackle pro-slavery movements and those who wished to see them as nonexistent unless they were submissive to their oppression.</p>
