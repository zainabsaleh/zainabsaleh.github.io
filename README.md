<h1>The Female Literary Association of Philadelphia</h1>
<p>The Female Literary Association of Philadelphia was formed in 1831, consisting of approximately twenty members who believed they “had a duty to develop their God-given intellectual powers” (Lindhorst 263). While the majority of African American literary societies were formed in response to the tyrannical and immoral oppression against black individuals, the Female Literary Association of Philadelphia wanted to promote their moral and intellectual development, specifically the development of these skills in regards to African American women and girls. Led by Sarah Mapps Douglass, a prominent abolitionist and educator in Philadelphia, these twenty women worked to oppose the common limits placed upon African American women, which was participation in public life as well as literary associations.</p>
<p>Marie Lindhorst wrote an article titled “Politics in a Box: Sarah Mapps Douglass and the Female Literary Association, 1831-1833,” in which she writes that the “goal of the Female Literary Association was self-improvement: education to disprove prejudice and to challenge white belief in the intellectual inferiority of African Americans” (269). Here, it is evident and certain that there was immense prejudice and bigotry, especially during a time where slavery was still existent and, even if a slave was “free,” <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> was not put in place yet, which <em>still</em> did not leave African Americans to be “separate but equal.” The FLA of Philadelphia yearned for equality, especially for African American women, and with the help of Sarah Douglass, these women fought to defy hostility brought on by the white race by advocating for their own intellectual development and the development of all African Americans, inspiring many literary societies and organizations to rise up and root for the African American race.</p>
<p>These members met each Tuesday for “recitation and reading” as mentioned in a blog post titled “Female Literary Association.” The post goes on to mention that each meeting began with an address prepared by a member (more often than not it would be Sarah Douglass), followed by “a scripture reading, silent reflection, and prayer.” The services and benefits of this society ranged from potential publication, although most likely the author would be placed under “anonymous” or a pseudonym, most likely “Lady of Color” (Porter 560), to mutual aid, which was one of the sole purposes of these societies. The FLA of Philadelphia also provided a space for growth and study for these women, seeing as they were deemed morally and intellectually inferior by the white majority and society in general.</p>
<p>These women submitted and wrote pieces that were put in a box and later read, which gained the attention of William Lloyd Garrison, creator of <em>The Liberator</em>, who helped publish the works of these women related to current issues such as colonization, slavery, and so much more. Eventually the FLA of Philadelphia went beyond literary practices and became a prominent part of the anti-slavery movement, in which Sarah Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison worked together to publish these women’s stories as opinions and remarks of current political issues, and with the anti-slavery movement heightening and becoming more recognized (only a few decades away from the amendment abolishing slavery), these women developed the Constitution of the Female Literary Society, sent in by Sarah Douglass to Garrison to be published in <em>The Liberator</em>. Garrison responded to Douglass’ inquiry about whether the constitution had been turned down for publication, in which he responds saying “The formation of this Society is a source of unspeakable satisfaction of my mind,” as mentioned in the “Female Literary Association” blog, going on to further say that her organization would inspire many women around the country to form similar literary socieites, also using their work as a counter-argument to the pro-slavery movement.</p>
<p>This society revolved around the political nature surrounding their existence; the denial of their existence, their lack of knowledge often seen as the key to insubordination, as mentioned by Wheeler and Johnson-Houston in “A Brief History of Library Service to African Americans,” and their overall input on anything that they disapprove of or wish to change. The government did not protect African Americans, specifically African American women in regards to this society, so their formation of this society sought to address the government’s lack of recognition to their abilities as scholars, writers, activists, and so much more. They were deemed unequal, and there was no law to protect them from the brutal conditions and bigotry that they endured. With the formation of this society, these women could write their emotions and frustrations with the country’s bigoted and colonizing nature, sharing their experiences and getting feedback and aid for their writing/expressions.</p>
<p>There were undoubtedly no rights by institutional power to allow the FLA of Philadelphia to exist; the society was primarily informal, and like many other African American literary societies and organizations, there was primarily no protection by institutional power to keep this society running. The society existed to serve the free and enslaved, and even though the Gradual Emancipation Act of 1780 in Pennsylvania existed, it did not condemn the slave-owners or advocate for the immediate freeing of slaves—it sought to “gradually” free slaves from owners, over a lengthy period, which undoubtedly did not improve conditions for slaves or “free” slaves over the next coming decades. During the time the FLA of Philadelphia formed, <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> and <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> did not come into place yet, and even <em>if</em> it was readily present during the 1830’s when the FLA of Philadelphia developed, the hostility towards African Americans in general was, and still is, present. As Wheeler and Johnson-Houston say, there is no “separate but equal;” separate is never equal. In addition to the above laws, even <em>Brown v. Louisiana</em>, which decided that facilities must be nondiscriminatory and equally applicable, did not guarantee an accepting nature for black individuals. We see this in the civil rights movement, decades after the abolishment of slavery, where black individuals are still segregated, attacked, belittled, and even killed in America. Even with racial segregation outlawed, the mental segregation often brought on by white individuals leads to these informal socieites being made to conquer the white supremacy it wishes to dismantle.</p>
<p>The only laws that protected these literary societies and granted mutual aid and appreciation during discriminatory and distraught times was immutable laws, as mentioned by Marie Lindhorst. Lindhorst writes, “In these words, there is strength and defiance, and an understanding that their self-development was a part of this claim on divinely-given rights” (269). These immutable laws, formed as the rights of our day-to-day lives, fostered an environment where these African American women dreamed of equality and education for themselves, their children, their partners, and so many more. While their society existed informally with no protection under the law for their society and themselves, they persevered and were granted potential publication, advocacy from people like William Lloyd Garrison, and the defiance to tackle pro-slavery movements and those who wished to see them as nonexistent unless they were submissive to their oppression.</p>

<h2>The History of Libraries</h2>
<p>The history of libraries dates back farther than I could have ever imagined; I was surprised to find information dating back to when records were being kept, where these records were the epitome of what libraries serve to communities, both past, present, and future. The antiquity of knowledge both served as a privilege and a dream for many individuals in the ancient world, where texts were kept on “papyrus or leather scrolls, inscribed on wax and clay tablets or bound in parchment codexes” (Cartwright). It is known, as referenced in the Encyclopedia Britannica, that libraries existed “dating from the first half of the 3rd millennium BC,” but that many records that our modern day libraries would find useful in regards to history were destroyed in wars and the eminent downfall of governments and rulers. These ancient libraries consisted of archive-like natures, where books were collected and used to enhance philosophical, classical, and historical knowledge for those who could potentially become scholars, medics, religious leaders, and so much more. The Encyclopedia Britannica also notes that “the most famous collection was that of the Peripatetic school, founded by Aristotle and systematically organized by him with the intention of facilitating scientific research.”</p>
<p>Collections of literature (Greek, Roman, Asian, etc.) were seen as a luxury, and when specifically looking at Rome during the ancient world, owning a library was seen as highly “fashionable.” Libraries could be in the rooms of houses, and when looking upon the research of the ancient world and libraries in general, it was usually the private libraries that were considered “libraries,” before the public library ever came to be implemented into societies. For example, Julius Caesar had planned a public library before his death, in which one was shortly built after. The phrase ingenia hominum rem publicam fecit (“He made men’s talents a public possession”) (“The History of Libraries”) was used to describe the overall gratefulness by those who could use public libraries to gain knowledge due to Caesar’s efforts. From the research I had gathered, it seemed to be that the texts that were kept in these libraries are, evidently, not much different to the libraries we have today; for example, Egypt had “archives” of “documents regarding cults, sacred texts, magical texts, and administrative records” (Cartwright). One of the major differences between the ancient world and the modern world was the shift from private libraries, where records and texts were kept from the public, to public libraries, where so much information is in reach like never before.</p>
<p>When it comes to libraries in the early United States, there was quite the itch for a way to reach literature or just to pursue the gift of scholarship. According the Digital Public Library of America, literary salons during the Enlightenment dominated the scene for those wishing to access literature, especially for women. This is because women, often shut out from learning, now had spaces to exchange knowledge, ideas, and thoughts on literature and beyond. The DPLA also notes that “private book clubs among wealthy men evolved into subscription libraries. Subscription, or membership, libraries were funded by membership fees or donations, with collections accessible only to paying members.” The shift from the ancient world to the 1700s did not seem promising to those who wished to become scholars, academics, etc.; with the private nature of the libraries in the ancient world to the 18th and 19th centuries, collections of useful and prominent information was still kept from those who could not afford memberships. This meant that without wealth or access to money, books were hard to find. The DPLA notes that even with Benjamin Franklin and the beginnings of the Library Company, where collections about education and religion typically, non-members still had to pay collateral for their borrowed book. It was then that Franklin had decided to create the United States’ first public library, the lending library, where books could be freely available to town members. Now tax-funded and board-governed, as the DPLA notes, libraries were open to all and the public was able to access the knowledge they yearned to hold onto. While the whole concept of the “lending library” was to profit from the public, these public libraries allowed an outlet of knowledge and growth as a society of many bright individuals.</p>
<p>These new libraries in the United States during the turn from private to public brought training in “cataloging, collection development, reference, and children’s librarianship” as the DPLA notes, which shows the amount of growth from the ancient world to the ever evolving world. One example of this shift was the Carnegie Library, where the demand for funding such a library (where the DPLA notes that rather than endowing libraries, ten percent of the annual funding of towns would supply building sites, where free service would be provided to the public) allowed spaces to be used by the public and created an atmosphere where scholarship was slowly starting to become more and more in demand. It has to be noted that while these libraries were public, African Americans were segregated (if allowed any access at all).</p>
<p>When looking at the UK in the 19th century and libraries during the time, the 1850 Public Libraries Act allowed free libraries and institutes to be used by the public. Beginning as libraries in homes and youth centers, public libraries created an atmosphere where libraries were slowly, but surely, dominating the scene for those wishing to access literature. As towns during the time were growing and suburbs emerged, free libraries emerged alongside it. It was precedented, and the UK focused, as this was seen as a “liberal agenda” or “Victorian agenda” like notion, that education improved almost everything and anything. While parliament was terrified of the costs to fund the public libraries, the Public Libraries Act 1919 “reformed the old system, taking responsibility for libraries away from the boroughs and giving it to county councils, which would now have the power to establish libraries without a referendum” (“Public Libraries”).</p>
<p>There are many kinds of libraries today, such as academic libraries serving to educate those attending colleges or universities, public libraries where I, as a kid, worshipped and admired, due to the fact that I could pick up a book and learn a language that was not my first. There are also specialized libraries, which I found on the internet and have never really heard of before, that focus on work relating to corporations, hospitals, museums, the military, businesses, and the government, as noted on the American Library Association’s website. There are digital libraries as well, where the issues of accessibility are becoming more and more present in society. As one can see, the history of libraries is a long one; from scripture on scrolls and clay tablets to physical books, digital books, libraries shifting from the private eye to the public atmosphere, the world has evolved, and the use of libraries has evolved with it. Library cards allow anyone to transport to a different scene, one that may feel out of reach. As I write this reflection, I remember seeing a post somewhere on social media where someone noted that their library card was one of their most prized possessions growing up. It felt like the most immense privilege for me as a child, and even as an adult, to be able to walk into a library and learn something new, something that has always felt completely out of reach.</p>
